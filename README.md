Currently codebase contains a lot of unnecessary files (created during development of the project). Start with [Instructions](./e2e_speech_indicASR/README.md) and trace which other files are useful (only the ones imported are useful). This will be fixed in a week or two. Data related processing will be added soon. Can't released dataset though :(
